  <h2>What is Blackathon?</h2>
  <p id="big_question">Can you name 3 prominent blacks in computing??</p>
  <p> Representation matters!!! Celebrities, co-workers, family members and friends all serve as major influences in our lives in determining a path we want to take in our future. Black technologist are few and far between, making up only 1% of the exponentially growing industry. In our technology classrooms, we make up less than 1% of the student body. In hackathons, jobs, and the media - black faces in tech seem invisible. It is time for us to see what we can be. It is time to see what those around us can accomplish and build. We exist and we need to share a space together to encourage and support one another, while working towards the future progress of our community (while building for our community).
